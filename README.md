<b>The challenge</b>

The Intro to Javascript challenge with Code First Girls is a 4-week challenge aiming to help people through the cost of living crisis.


With the UK experiencing the biggest price hike for fifty years, we challenge you to build a product, app, or website that will empower everyday citizens to manage their budgets and help alleviate the challenges of the current cost of living crisis.
Projects could focus on budgeting tools, open banking solutions, awareness, or even education! Make sure that youâ€™re not rebuilding something that already exists, and use your unique perspective to build something innovative and exciting."
