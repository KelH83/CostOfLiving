# CFG intro to javascript challenge project - This project was one of the 3 chosen as a finalist

I had a few initial ideas for this project including a budgeting calculator, help for pets, utilities comparison, the ideas just kept coming so I decided to create a multi-page website.
As I was limited on time I couldn't put as much information into it as I'd have liked, little things like the careers quiz I would have made more in-depth and when you get your suggested career results had links to appropriate courses to get started on your journey. I would have made a functioning search bar but right now it just alerts the user to say it's not working. I would also have liked to create personalised suggestions, so for example on the kids page my initial idea was to ask the user their child's age and then adapt the information for that age, however because of time constraints I had to keep it very basic and general.

<b>The challenge</b>

The Intro to Javascript challenge with Code First Girls is a 4-week challenge aiming to help people through the cost of living crisis.


With the UK experiencing the biggest price hike for fifty years, we challenge you to build a product, app, or website that will empower everyday citizens to manage their budgets and help alleviate the challenges of the current cost of living crisis.
